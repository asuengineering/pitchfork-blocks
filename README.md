## Includes

This plugin leverages the following libraries for functionality delivered within certain blocks.

- This plugin loads a copy of the SASS files from the [Bootstrap 4 library](https://github.com/ASU/asu-unity-stack/tree/dev/packages/bootstrap4-theme) within the ASU Unity design kit. It includes only the design tokens for easier SASS references and expects that the theme will load the remainder of the required BS4 files.  

- The breadcrumb block is an ACF wrapper for the [Hybrid Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/themehybrid/hybrid-breadcrumbs) composer-based assset for including breadcrumbs.

- The sidebar block makes use of a custom ACF field group for menu selection which can be found within the [ASU Engineering's GitHub organization](https://github.com/asuengineering/ACF-Menu-Select). 

## Development

- Run `npm install` and `composer install` prior to local development.
- SASS and JS compile & watch tasks are triggered via WP-Gulp and `npm start` from the project root.
